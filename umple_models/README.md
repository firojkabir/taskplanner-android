## 1. Getting Started with Umple Online

Umple Online allows you to create models and generate code from them easily. Follow these steps to use Umple Online for generating Java code:

### Step 1: Access Umple Online

Visit https://cruise.umple.org/umpleonline in your web browser.

### Step 2: Add Your Models

**Copy the models** from your `.ump` files and **paste them into the Umple editor**.

### Step 3: Visualize Your Model

In the **EXAMPLES** section, select **"Class diagrams"** to generate and display a visual representation of your model.

### Step 4: Generate Java Code

In the **GENERATE** section, select **"Java code"**.

If your models are **correct**, the Java code will be generated automatically and displayed in the **Code Preview** section below the editor.

## 2. Using the Generated Code in Your Application

Once you have generated the Java code, follow these steps to integrate it into your project:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Java Project

Open your development environment (e.g., **Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse**).

Create a **new Java project** or an existing project where you want to integrate the generated code.

### Step 2: Add Generated Code to Your Project

Copy the generated `.java` files and paste them inside the appropriate package in your project (e.g., `src/model` for model files, `src/controller` for controllers).

### Step 3: Use the Generated Classes

- Import and use the generated classes in your application as needed.

### Step 4: Compile and Run the Application

- Ensure all dependencies are included.

- Build and run the application to see the generated model in action.
